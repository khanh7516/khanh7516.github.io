        If you just want a simple tablet for a reasonable price, it’s hard to go
        wrong with the standard Apple iPad. Starting at $329, the basic iPad has
        a 10.2-inch display with good brightness (500 nits) and a relatively
        speedy A13 Bionic chip. It’s also the last iPad that still features an
        old-school Touch ID home button.

        After being refreshed last year, the ninth-gen iPad got updated features
        including Apple Pencil support, improved cameras (in front and back) and
        double the base storage (64GB, up from 32GB). And just like its more
        expensive siblings, the standard iPad is available in a WiFi-only model
        or with optional 4G LTE cellular connectivity. The entry-level iPad is
        also the cheapest device Apple sells that gives you access to the App
        Store, which makes it a good multimedia device and a handy way of
        managing your media library across your other Apple devices at an
        affordable price.
