        Powered by the same Apple M2 chips you get in MacBooks, the iPad Pro is
        one of the fastest and most well-built tablets you can buy today. It’s
        available in two sizes (11 and 12.9 inches) and works with a range of
        accessories including the Apple Pencil and the extremely useful (but
        pricey) Magic Keyboard. And thanks to their 120Hz ProMotion mini-LED
        displays, the iPad Pro’s screen boasts strong brightness and fluid
        visuals, regardless of whether you’re watching a movie or creating a
        slideshow presentation. Recent versions of iPadOS have also made Apple’s
        most premium tablet a much more capable work device, with the addition
        of new sidebars for quickly switching between apps, a more powerful
        desktop-like UI for Safari, and various new toolbars throughout.

        The main downside is that starting at $800 for a base 11-inch model with
        128GB of storage, Apple’s iPad Pros aren’t cheap, and that’s before you
        tack on any extras like cellular connectivity or a keyboard. But
        considering there’s a good chance a new iPad Pro is more powerful than
        your current laptop, there isn’t really anything you can throw at
        Apple’s top-of-the-line tablet it can’t handle.

        One final note is that if you like the iPad Pro but want something a bit
        more affordable, there’s also the fifth-gen iPad Air. This one is
        powered by the M1 chipset, but it has Apple Pencil support and optional
        5G connectivity. And with a 10.9-inch screen, it’s basically the same
        size as the smaller iPad Pro too. The main difference is that the iPad
        Air’s display isn’t quite as bright and doesn’t support a 120Hz refresh
        rate. But if you’re ok with that, the 5th-gen iPad Air is essentially an
        iPad Pro with a less fancy screen that starts at $599 instead of $799.
