        While most people think of Microsoft’s Surface Pro devices as a line of
        2-in-1s, because they don’t come with a keyboard (you need to purchase
        it separately), that technically makes them tablets. But don’t be
        fooled, because thanks to Windows 11 and support for a range of 12h-gen
        Intel processors, Microsoft’s Surface Pros are designed for
        productivity.

        The latest Surface Pro 9 has a beautiful display with a smooth 120Hz
        refresh rate and improved stereo speakers, while the inclusion of an IR
        facial recognition camera allows you to log in to the system in a snap.
        Another nice bonus is that unlike a lot of tablets, the Surface Pro 9’s
        SSD is user accessible, allowing you to upgrade its storage yourself
        whenever you want. And thanks to improvements in Windows 11, the Surface
        Pro 9 is better suited to life as a tablet without ever needing to
        attach a smart keyboard thanks to larger app icons and more
        touch-friendly controls.
