          A new dark fantasy Three Kingdoms action RPG from Team NINJA, the
          developers of Nioh. <br />
          184 AD, Later Han Dynasty China. The land is overcome by chaos and
          destruction. The imperial dynasty that prospered for many years is now
          about to collapse. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is a dramatic,
          action-packed story of a nameless militia soldier fighting for
          survival in a dark fantasy version of the Later Han Dynasty where
          demons plague the Three Kingdoms. Players fight off deadly creatures
          and enemy soldiers using swordplay based on the Chinese martial arts,
          attempting to overcome the odds by awakening the true power from
          within. Wo Long refers to a crouching dragon, and also refers to a
          hero or person of greatness who is not yet known. This is the story of
          officers, who will later become heroes, during their ‘unknown’ period,
          and also the story of a protagonist’s rise from being a ‘nobody’.
          Demons in the Kingdom A dark fantasy set during the chaotic Three
          Kingdoms period, the narrative vividly tells the tale of a militia
          soldier’s strenuous fight for survival during a Later Han Dynasty
          infested with demons. It’s madness in the Three Kingdoms like never
          before!

          AUTHENTIC GAMEPLAY <br />
          With the dual stick controls, each stick represents one of your feet.
          You will need to learn how to control them and transfer weight, just
          like on a real skateboard. The physics have been developed with a
          focus on realism, smoothness and immersion. Just like in real life for
          a new skateboarder, the first hours can seem challenging, but once you
          have mastered the technique, you will feel the unrivalled thrill of
          pulling off your very first kickflip! Session: Skate Sim also includes
          full options customisation, so you can enjoy the perfect experience
          tailored to you. A full tutorial provides all the help you need to get
          started, and you can choose from four difficulty levels! <br />
          THE 1990S AND SKATE CULTURE Inspired by the golden age of street
          skating – the 1990s – Session: Skate Sim lets you experience true
          skateboarding and its culture: no scoring system; just you, your spot
          and your imagination! There's no need for judges to tell you that your
          noseslide or varial heelflip are perfect for this spot. And because
          certain locations are iconic, the developers have added several of
          them to the game for you to skate in and express your creativity,
          including Black Hubbas (New York City), Brooklyn banks (New York
          City), FDR Park (Philadelphia) and many other spots.
