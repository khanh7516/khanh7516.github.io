            Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is being review bombed on Steam as fans
            complain about numerous issues present in the PC version of the
            game. Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is the latest Soulslike game made by
            Team Ninja, the developers behind other titles in this genre like
            Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin and the Nioh series of
            games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has received positive reviews from critics,
            although its score on Metacritic is lower than that of both Nioh
            titles. Praise has been directed towards its gameplay and level of
            challenge, with some comparisons made to 2019’s Sekiro: Shadows Die
            Twice as well. Despite the overall positive critical reception, it
            looks like fans are facing some issues with the PC version of Wo
            Long as users are now leaving negative reviews for the game on
            Steam.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time of this writing, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty has a rating of
            “Mostly Negative” on Steam with almost 6,000 user reviews. By
            comparison, Nioh has a “Mostly Positive” rating on Steam, with its
            sequel sitting at “Very Positive” on the platform. Judging by the
            user reviews, it looks like players are facing all sorts of
            optimization problems with the PC port of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,
            which appears to be the primary reason for them leaving negative
            ratings. In fact, many users go on to praise the gameplay of Wo Long
            in the review before sharing their disappointment in the current
            state of the PC version.

          />
          <p>
            Many fans mention the mouse and keyboard controls being poor, while
            others claim to have run into frame rate issues while playing Wo
            Long on PC. Even users with a relatively higher-end gaming PC are
            reporting problems, so it doesn’t look like the issues are limited
            to lower-spec machines. The system requirements of Wo Long: Fallen
            Dynasty don’t appear to be that high either, as a GeForce RTX 2060
            or Radeon RX 5700 XT is needed for 60 FPS gameplay at 1080p.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some players also recommend waiting for the developer to fix the
            optimization issues in Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and playing Nioh 2
            instead. Nioh and Nioh 2 launched first on PS4 before being ported
            to PC, but Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty was a simultaneous release on all
            platforms. So, perhaps the development team needed that extra time
            to better optimize the PC version of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty and
            properly address all the users’ concerns with the port.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One,
            and Xbox Series X/S.
